# AQA CS AS Notes

## 3.5 Fundamentals of data representation

### 3.5.1 Number systems
+ natural numbers

**definition**: those are numbers used for counting.

**examples**: 0,1,2,3,4
``` 
this is an area for code or examples etc

Counting uses natural numbers
A set of natural number can expressed as:
N={0,1,2,3...}

```

+ integer numbers

**definition**: these are whole numbers.

**examples**: 2, 5, 2552, 117
```
A set of integer numbers can be expressed as:
Z={-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}
and so on

```

+ rational numbers

**definition**: these can be expressed as fractions.

**examples**: 0.5, 0.2, 0.75
```

+ irrational numbers

**definition**: an irrational number cannot be written as a fraction

**examples**: pi, square root of any positive number that isn't a square number

```

+ real numbers

**definition**: all possible real world quantities, including rational and irrational numbers.

**examples**: 1.23, 2625, -46548 etc

```

+ ordinal numbers

**definition**: when objects are placed in order the ordinal number is the position number of that object.
               	1	    2		    3
**examples**: lemon, pineapple, screwdriver
```
These can be expressed as:
S={"lemon", "pineapple", "screwdriver"}
etc              
```

### 3.5.2 Number bases
+ base 2: those are binary numbers. example: 1010<sub>2</sub>. See [this site](https://bournetocode.com/projects/AQA_AS_Theory/pages/3-5.html) for more infomation
+ base 10
+ base 16
+ conversion between denary, binary and hex

### 3.5.3 Units of information
+ bit and bytes
+ units of kilo, kilbi etc

### 3.5.4 Binary number system

#### unsigned binary
#### unsigned binary arithmetics
#### signed binary with two's complement
#### fixed point form binary representation of numbers with fractional parts

### 3.5.5 Information encoding system

#### Character form of a decimal digit
#### ASCII and Unicode
#### Error checking and correction

### 3.5.6 Representing images, sound and other data

#### Bit patterns, images,  sound  and other  data
#### Analogue and digital
#### Analogue and digital conversion
#### Bitmapped graphics
#### Digital representation of sound
#### Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)
#### Data compression
#### Encryption
